### Rails Stupid Coaching

This was an exercise I did at the Le Wagon bootcamp on my first rails class. It allow to learn about routes, controllers and views.
The user can say anything to the coach, but the coach will not respond well unless the user specifically says "I am going to work", since that's all he cares about.
